## CC 28
I have created two classes 
- Movie : to hold all movies
- MovieSorter : to contain the sorting Functions
---

### the Movie class  has 3 attributes   
- title 
- year
- genres

---

#### in MovieSorter it has two sort function by title , year (Descending) BY title, will ignore leading English letters ("A," "An," "The").
