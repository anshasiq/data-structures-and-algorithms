### Approach & Efficiency

The approach used in this to make The first stack acts like the enqueue method and push inside it
and making the second stack act like the dequeue method.

on dequeue the values from the first stack will be popped and pushed inside the second stack
this will allow us to make the FIFO principle for the queue.

### Big O

For the enqueue O(1) , Dequeue O(n).
