Merge Sort is a popular divide-and-conquer algorithm used to sort an array or list of elements. It works by repeatedly dividing the unsorted list into smaller sublists, sorting those sublists, and then merging them back together. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Merge Sort works:

1. **Divide**: The first step is to divide the unsorted list into smaller sublists. This is done recursively until each sublist contains only one element, as a single element is inherently sorted. The division process continues until you have a set of small, sorted sublists.

2. **Conquer (Sort)**: Once you have these small sorted sublists, you start merging them back together in a sorted manner. To do this, you compare the elements in the sublists and merge them in ascending order. This process continues until you have merged all the sublists into a single, fully sorted list.

3. **Merge**: Merging is the most critical step in Merge Sort. You take two adjacent sublists and compare the elements from each sublist one by one. You always choose the smaller of the two elements and move it to the new merged list. This process continues until you've emptied both sublists.

   Example:
   Let's say you have two sublists:
    - Sublist A: [2, 5, 9]
    - Sublist B: [1, 6, 8]

   You start comparing the elements from A and B and build the merged list:
    - Compare 2 and 1, choose 1.
    - Compare 2 and 6, choose 2.
    - Compare 5 and 6, choose 5.
    - Compare 9 and 8, choose 8.

   The merged list becomes [1, 2, 5, 8, 6, 9].

4. **Repeat**: Steps 1 through 3 are repeated recursively until you have merged all the sublists into a single sorted list.

5. **Combine**: Finally, you have a fully sorted list that contains all the elements from the original list.

The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n) in the worst and average cases, which makes it efficient for sorting large datasets. It's a stable sort, which means it maintains the relative order of equal elements. One drawback is that it requires additional space for merging, which can be a concern for large datasets, but it's a stable and reliable sorting algorithm.
